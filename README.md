# Fynotek
A package for working with words in Fynotek, a conlang by mochaspen.

## Documentation
See the [javadoc](https://mathmaster13.github.io/fynotek-java/javadoc/overview-tree.html).

## Compatibility
All code in this repo was compiled with Java 17, but compiling from Java 15 may be possible. However, only Java versions 17 and later are supported.
Using any part of this project with Kotlin is also supported, and Kotlin files in this project were compiled with Kotlin 1.6 and target Java 17 or higher.

There is an older version of `InflectionDemo` [here](https://mathmaster13.github.io/fynotek-java/conjugator/index.html) which is compiled with Java 8 and can probably be compiled to run on even earlier versions, but it does not recieve feature updates, only bugfixes.

## Demos
Demos can be found in the [src/demos](src/demos) folder. See [RUNNING.md](RUNNING.md) for info on how to run demos. The `fynotek` package itself is at [src/io/github/mathmaster13/aspenlangs/fynotek](src/io/github/mathmaster13/aspenlangs/fynotek).

## Current Features
- Mark noun case/verb tense
- Apply prefixes and suffixes to words
- Match the marking of one word to another
- Convert a number to the Fynotek number system
- Check if a word is phonotactically valid in Fynotek

## Known Bugs
None yet. Report any if you find them!
