# FynotekWord
A class for working with words in Fynotek, a conlang by mochaspen.

## Demos
Demos can be found in the `com/mathmaster13/fynotekword` folder along with the `FynotekWord` library itself.

## Current Features
- Apply ablaut to a word
- Mark a common or proper noun for case
- Mark a verb for tense
- Apply prefixes and suffixes to words
- Match the ablaut of one word to another

## Planned Features
- [ ] Convert a number to the Fynotek number system
- [ ] Set up a way to run this code online

## Known Bugs
- Inputting `folo` as the detached modifier in the `AblautMatchDemo` (and the `matchAblaut()` function in general) causes incorrect behavior. This should be fixed soon.

## Credits
mochaspen, for making [Fynotek](https://linktr.ee/fynotek "Fynotek Resources") and a Fynotek Conjugator in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/584256352/ "Fynotek Conjugator in Scratch") that inspired this.
